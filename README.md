# AI made these games

These games were created by AI agents that work together with [Chatforce](https://chatforceai.com/).

Chatforce makes it easy for you to direct an  AI workforce to build complex, reliable, shippable software.

# Why Chatforce exists
The difference between an LLM and an AI agent is that an LLM just generates an output, while an AI agent can take action. 

But is two agents better than one? The paper "[More Agents Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05120)" shows that as the number of agents increase, so does the quality of their output. 

The only challenge is orchestrating the agents to accomplish a task. Chatforce can support hundreds of collaborating agents.
